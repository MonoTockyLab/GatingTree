## 1. Introduction

**GatingTree** is an R package designed to enhance the analysis of group-specific effects in cytometry data.

#### Current Challenges
Advancements in cytometry technologies allow for the simultaneous analysis of numerous markers. However, they also introduce challenges in the data-oriented analysis of biological effects, such as treatment effects, within high-dimensional data.

Traditional methods such as manual gating are insufficient for these demands. While dimensional reduction methods (e.g., UMAP) with or without clustering are increasingly common, they struggle with reproducibility across experiments. Moreover, the cell clusters they identify may not translate effectively into practical gating strategies for laboratory use, further exacerbating the **reproducibility crisis in biological and medical research**.

#### Solutions GatingTree Offers

**GatingTree** offers a distinct approach by **not relying on dimensional reduction**. Instead, it explores the multidimensional marker space through **pathfinding analysis to pinpoint group-specific features**. By deliberately avoiding multidimensional analyses such as PCA and UMAP, as well as clustering algorithms, GatingTree provides straightforward solutions that can be directly applied in downstream applications such as flow cytometric sorting of target populations.

## 2. Installation

To install **GatingTree**, first ensure that you have the `devtools` package installed:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, install **GatingTree** from GitHub:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("MonoTockyLab/GatingTree", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## 3. Vignettes

The **GatingTree** package includes vignettes to assist users in efficiently applying GatingTree to cytometry data.

- **[Basic Workflow](https://MonoTockyLab.github.io/GatingTree/articles/GatingTree_Workflow.html)**: This vignette provides users with a step-by-step guide to processing and transforming data, applying GatingTree analysis, and visualizing results.

- **[DefineNegatives](https://MonoTockyLab.github.io/GatingTree/articles/DefineNegatives.html)**: This vignette demonstrates how the function `DefineNegatives` can be used to determine positive/negative thresholds for markers, which is a critical preprocessing step for GatingTree analysis.

- **[Using CSV File Inputs](https://MonoTockyLab.github.io/GatingTree/articles/UsingCSVfileInputs.html)**: This vignette shows how to import cytometry sample data as CSV files and initialize a `FlowObject`.

*Note: You can access the vignettes within R using the `browseVignettes("GatingTree")` command after installing the package.*

## 4. Package Documentation

The **GatingTree** package documentation is available online:

- **Website**: [https://MonoTockyLab.github.io/GatingTree/](https://MonoTockyLab.github.io/GatingTree/)

This site includes all the function reference manuals and vignettes (tutorials).

In addition to the HTML manual pages, a PDF manual for the **GatingTree** package is available. You can find it in the installed package directory under `doc/`, or you can access it directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/MonoTockyLab/GatingTree/blob/main/inst/doc/GatingTree_0.2.0.pdf).

## 6. The Ono Lab (MonoTockyLab)

<img src="vignettes/assets/MonoLab.jpg" alt="MonoTockyLab" align="center" width="40%">

**The Masahiro Ono Lab (MonoTockyLab)** offers innovative approaches to analyzing omics and flow cytometric data. The lab is particularly well-known for their development of Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-Activity (**Tocky**) and integrated analysis of immunological data using both experiments and computational analysis.

**Principal Investigator**: Dr. Masahiro Ono, Reader in Immunology at Imperial College London.

Dr. Ono is **the creator and developer of Tocky**. He innovated the transgenic and computational technologies that constitute Tocky.

In 2008, Dr. Ono initiated his pioneering transition from molecular immunology to becoming an **Integrated Experimental and Computational Immunologist**, demonstrating his visionary leadership and pioneering spirit in the development and application of multidimensional analysis and computational methods to address experimental and immunological problems. Tocky represents one of the fusion technologies that Dr. Ono has both created and developed.

Tocky employs the Fluorescent Timer protein to analyze the temporal dynamics of cell activities and development *in vivo*. His lab integrates molecular biology, immunology, and computational analysis to develop novel research tools, thereby enhancing the understanding of immune cell biology.
