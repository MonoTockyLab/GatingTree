**GatingTree** is an R package designed to enhance the analysis of group-specific effects in cytometry data.

### Current Challenges
- **Advancements in Technology**: Cytometry technologies have advanced to allow simultaneous analysis of numerous markers.
- **Complex Data Analysis**: These advancements introduce challenges in analyzing biological effects, such as treatment effects, within high-dimensional data.
- **Limitations of Traditional Methods**:
  - Manual gating does not meet complex analytical demands.
  - Dimensional reduction methods like UMAP, with or without clustering, are commonly used but struggle with:
    - **Reproducibility**: Poor reproducibility across experiments.
    - **Practical Application**: Identified cell clusters often do not translate into effective gating strategies in the lab.
- **Reproducibility Crisis**: These issues contribute to a reproducibility crisis in biological and medical research.

### Solutions GatingTree Offers
- **Innovative Approach**: 
  - **No Dimensional Reduction**: Does not rely on dimensional reduction techniques.
  - **Pathfinding Analysis**: Explores the multidimensional marker space to pinpoint group-specific features.
- **Avoidance of Standard Analyses**:
  - Deliberately avoids traditional multidimensional analyses like PCA and UMAP.
  - Does not use clustering algorithms.
- **Practical Applications**: Provides straightforward solutions that are:
  - Directly applicable in downstream processes.
  - Ideal for tasks such as flow cytometric sorting of target populations.
