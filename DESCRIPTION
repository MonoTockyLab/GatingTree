Description: Implements the Gating Tree methodology, a novel pathfinding approach for analyzing high-dimensional cytometry data, including both flow and mass cytometry. This package circumvents traditional dimensional reduction and clustering by utilizing novel pathfinding algorithms that involve enrichment scores and gating entropy. These algorithms effectively explore the multidimensional marker space and identify group-specific features. The package includes functions for data transformation, visualization, and the application of advanced machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, to enhance analysis. The methodology is designed to produce outputs that are immediately usable as gating strategies for downstream experimental applications.
