Description: Implements the Gating Tree methodology, a novel pathfinding approach for analyzing high-dimensional cytometry data, including flow and mass cytometry. This package circumvents traditional dimensional reduction and clustering by utilizing enrichment scores and gating entropy to effectively identify group-specific features. It encompasses functions for data transformation, visualization, and the application of advanced machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, to enhance analysis. The methodology is crafted to produce outputs that are immediately usable as gating strategies for downstream experimental applications, demonstrating superior performance in both simulated and real cytometric datasets.
