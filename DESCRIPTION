Description: This package offers a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing high-dimensional cytometric data, including flow and mass cytometry. It uniquely employs the novel GatingTree method, which enables comprehensive identification of group-specific effects across experimental groups without relying on dimensional reduction or clustering, enhancing the reproducibility of analyses. The toolkit includes a range of helper functions for data import, transformation, and effective visualization of GatingTree outputs, providing all essential tools for robust data analysis.
